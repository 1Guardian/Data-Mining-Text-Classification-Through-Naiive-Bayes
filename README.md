# Data-Mining-Text-Classification-Through-Naiive-Bayes

This project shows how to implement a Naiive Bayes algorithm to classify a given document as either being about computer science, or about some other topic. This is commonly used in detecting spam emails, or when machine learning needs to classify the works of various authors. The first method uses numerical counts of how many times each word appears in the training and test data, while the second showcases when the counts are a simple binary true, for found, or false, for not found.

The end of the project has the second method in which binary decisions are used instead of counts, but this work is not my own and is my lab partner's work, who is credited in the header of the pdf.

The project is in a pdf version of the ipynb for easier viewing by anyone
